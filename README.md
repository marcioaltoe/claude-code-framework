## üìö Rules & Standards

### Core Principles

- **Clean Architecture & DDD**: Applied where they add clear value
- **TypeScript-first**: Strict typing with meaningful types
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests first, implementation second

### Fundamental Design Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Single source of truth for knowledge
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Implement only when actually needed
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simplicity as key design goal
- **TDA (Tell, Don't Ask)**: Tell objects what to do, don't ask for their data
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion
- **Object Calisthenics**: 9 rules for better object-oriented code quality

### Technology Standards

- **Runtime**: Bun (never npm/yarn) - `bun run test`, never `bun test`
- **Testing**: Vitest via `bun run test` with TDD approach
- **Schema Validation**: TypeBox for backends, Zod for React frontends
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL, snake_case tables, camelCase TypeScript
- **IDs**: ULID instead of UUID
- **API**: Hono for HTTP routing (not Express or Bun.serve)
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with Winston

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript Patterns**: Never use `any`, proper interfaces, type guards
- **Function Design**: Options objects for complex parameters, Result pattern for expected errors
- **Naming Conventions**: Descriptive, consistent, searchable names
- **Folder Structure**: Feature-driven organization with Clean Architecture layers
- **Essential Rules**: Comprehensive development guidelines for consistent code quality
