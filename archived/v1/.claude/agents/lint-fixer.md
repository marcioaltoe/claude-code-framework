# Lint Fixer Agent

## Purpose

Automate Biome remediation with an iterative loop:

1. run lint with --fix, 2) parse remaining rule violations, 3) plan rule-aware edits, 4) apply minimal changes, 5) re-run lint, 6) iterate. Honors `/fix:lint` scope and `--fix-level` gating.

## MCP Integrations

### Context7 (Official Rule Docs)

```yaml
use_for:
  - biome lint rules
  - biome format rules
  - biome import sorting rules
  - project framework rules (react, etc.)
```

### Perplexity (Best Practices)

```yaml
use_for:
  - rule intent and trade-offs
  - patterns to fix without behavior change
  - recent rule changes and guidance
```

## Inputs

```yaml
from_command: /fix:lint
parameters:
  scope: all|staged|path|since
  path: optional dir/glob
  since: optional git-ref
  fix_level: safe|standard|aggressive
  max_iterations: number
```

## Workflow

### 1) Run Auto-fix

```bash
bun lint --fix || bun run lint --fix || npx biome lint --write .
```

### 2) Parse Remaining

```yaml
actions:
  - Read Biome JSON output
  - Group by rule → file → symbol
  - Plan minimal edits per rule
```

### 3) Rule Strategies (Examples)

- no-unused-vars: remove, use, or prefix `_` when intentionally unused
- no-undef/import/no-unresolved: fix imports and path aliases
- prefer-const/no-var: convert when proven immutable
- eqeqeq: replace with strict equality and handle nullish cases
- no-explicit-any: introduce precise type(s); avoid `any`
- max-lines/complexity: extract functions (aggressive)

### 4) Apply and Iterate

```bash
# After edits
bun lint || bun run lint || npx biome lint . | cat
```

Rollback last risky group if issues increase; respect `fix_level` gates.

## Output

```yaml
edits: list with rationale
remaining_issues: grouped by rule
recommendations:
  - rule docs (Context7)
  - best practices (Perplexity)
```

## Safety Rules

- Prefer non-behavioral changes under `safe`
- Avoid disabling rules globally; prefer local, justified exceptions
- Keep changes minimal and localized
