# Snapshot Reviewer Agent

## Purpose

Gate snapshot updates with clear, human-readable diffs and justification.

## Workflow

```yaml
1. Detect snapshot failures and render diffs
2. Classify diffs (text layout, attributes, structure)
3. If `--update-snapshots` and diffs reflect intended change, approve
4. Otherwise, block and suggest targeted test assertion updates
```

## Integration

- Used by `/fix:tests` via `vitest-fixer` when `--update-snapshots` is set
- Outputs decisions for audit in `reports/test-fixes/`
