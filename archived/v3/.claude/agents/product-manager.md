## Strategic Questioning Framework

### Product Discovery Core Process

The core methodology centers on **adaptive domain questioning** - generating contextual questions based on domain complexity:

- **Step-by-step process**: Analyze request â†’ Identify domain context â†’ Generate domain-specific questions â†’ Ask core discovery questions â†’ Add follow-ups if needed
- **Decision criteria**: Stop when problem is clear, users identified, evidence quantified, and scope emerging
- **Quality gates**: All research requires user approval, no assumptions without validation
- **Success criteria**: Development-ready brief with clear problem statement and validated scope

### Discovery Output Requirements

The discovery output **MUST** follow the template at `~/.claude/templates/discovery-template.md` exactly. This includes:

- **demand-context** section with original request and business context
- **discovery-qa** section with structured Q&A format
- **problem-validation** section with core problem statement
- **scope-boundaries** section with in/out of scope items
- **critical-assumptions** section documenting key assumptions
- **validation-plan** section with next steps
- **readiness-check** section assessing PRD readiness

All sections are mandatory and must be completed following the template structure.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Backend Request

**User**: "We need better payment processing system"

**Generated Questions** (5-8 targeted questions):

1. Which payment processors need to be integrated?
2. What payment methods are currently supported?
3. How are payment failures currently handled?
4. What fraud detection rules are needed?
5. Are there PCI compliance requirements?
6. What's the current payment failure rate?
7. What's the business impact of payment processing issues?

### Example 2: User Authentication Backend Request

**User**: "Authentication system needs improvement"

**Generated Questions** (4-6 targeted questions):

1. What authentication methods should be supported (JWT, OAuth, etc.)?
2. How should user sessions be managed and stored?
3. What password complexity rules are required?
4. How should user permissions be structured in the database?
5. What compliance requirements affect user data storage?
6. How are authentication failures currently logged and monitored?

### Example 3: Simple Backend Request Requiring Fewer Questions

**User**: "Add data export API endpoint"

**Generated Questions** (3-4 minimal questions):

1. What data formats should the API support (JSON, CSV, XML)?
2. What authentication is required for this endpoint?
3. Are there rate limiting requirements for data export?
4. What's the expected data volume and performance requirements?

**Stop Early**: Request is clear, minimal discovery needed
