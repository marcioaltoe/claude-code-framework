## Architectural Design Methodology

### Requirements Analysis Framework

**Strategic Questioning Protocol:**

1. **Domain Constraints Identification**

   - Business rules and regulatory requirements
   - Industry standards and compliance needs
   - Data privacy and security constraints
   - Integration requirements with existing systems

2. **Performance & Scalability Analysis**

   - Expected load patterns and peak usage
   - Response time requirements and SLA definitions
   - Geographic distribution and latency needs
   - Growth projections and scaling requirements

3. **Technical Context Assessment**
   - Existing technology stack and team capabilities
   - Operational constraints and deployment requirements
   - Budget limitations and timeline constraints
   - Risk tolerance and critical failure points

### Architecture Design Process

**Phase 1: System Analysis**

```typescript
// Current System Understanding
- Map existing components and their relationships
- Identify architectural boundaries and coupling points
- Analyze data flow and integration patterns
- Document technical debt and constraint factors
```

**Phase 2: Solution Design**

```typescript
// Architecture Pattern Selection
- Evaluate microservices vs monolithic approaches
- Consider event-driven vs request/response patterns
- Assess CQRS applicability for complex domains
- Design data architecture and storage strategies
```

**Phase 3: Technology Stack Decisions**

```typescript
// Stack Selection Criteria
- Team expertise and learning curve assessment
- Community support and ecosystem maturity
- Performance characteristics and scalability
- Integration capabilities and vendor lock-in risks
```

### Clean Architecture Implementation Guidance

**Domain Layer Design:**

```typescript
// Pure business logic - zero external dependencies
export class Order {
  constructor(
    private readonly id: OrderId,
    private readonly customerId: CustomerId,
    private items: OrderItem[],
    private status: OrderStatus
  ) {}

  addItem(item: OrderItem): void {
    this.validateItemAddition(item);
    this.items.push(item);
  }

  private validateItemAddition(item: OrderItem): void {
    if (this.status !== OrderStatus.DRAFT) {
      throw new OrderNotModifiableError(this.id);
    }
  }
}
```

**Application Layer Architecture:**

```typescript
// Use cases orchestrating domain logic
export class ProcessOrderUseCase {
  constructor(
    private readonly orderRepository: OrderRepository,
    private readonly paymentGateway: PaymentGateway,
    private readonly eventBus: EventBus
  ) {}

  async execute(command: ProcessOrderCommand): Promise<OrderResponseDto> {
    const order = await this.orderRepository.findById(command.orderId);
    if (!order) throw new OrderNotFoundError(command.orderId);

    const payment = await this.paymentGateway.processPayment(order.getTotal());
    order.markAsProcessed(payment.getId());

    await this.orderRepository.save(order);
    await this.eventBus.publish(new OrderProcessedEvent(order));

    return OrderMapper.toResponseDto(order);
  }
}
```

**Infrastructure Layer Patterns:**

```typescript
// Concrete implementations of domain interfaces
export class PostgresOrderRepository implements OrderRepository {
  constructor(private readonly db: Database) {}

  async save(order: Order): Promise<void> {
    const dto = OrderMapper.toPersistenceDto(order);
    await this.db.query(
      "INSERT INTO orders (id, customer_id, items, status) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)",
      [dto.id, dto.customerId, dto.items, dto.status]
    );
  }
}
```

### Microservices Architecture Patterns

**Service Decomposition Strategy:**

```typescript
// Domain-Driven Service Boundaries
- Order Management Service (order lifecycle)
- Payment Processing Service (payment operations)
- Inventory Management Service (stock operations)
- Customer Service (customer data and preferences)
```

**Inter-Service Communication:**

```typescript
// Event-Driven Communication
export class OrderCreatedEvent {
  constructor(
    public readonly orderId: OrderId,
    public readonly customerId: CustomerId,
    public readonly items: OrderItem[],
    public readonly timestamp: Date
  ) {}
}

// Synchronous Communication for Consistency
export interface PaymentGateway {
  processPayment(amount: Money): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  refundPayment(paymentId: PaymentId): Promise<RefundResult>;
}
```

### Technology Stack Decision Framework

**Database Selection Matrix:**

```typescript
// PostgreSQL: ACID compliance, complex queries, strong consistency
// MongoDB: Document flexibility, horizontal scaling, eventual consistency
// Redis: Caching, session management, real-time features
// EventStore: Event sourcing, audit trails, temporal queries
```

**API Framework Considerations:**

```typescript
// Hono: Performance-focused, TypeScript-first, edge deployment
// Express: Mature ecosystem, extensive middleware, community support
// Fastify: High performance, built-in validation, plugin architecture
// tRPC: Type-safe APIs, full-stack TypeScript, developer experience
```

### Architectural Decision Record (ADR) Template

```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

- Business requirements and constraints
- Technical constraints and existing architecture
- Team capabilities and timeline

## Decision

- Chosen architectural approach
- Key components and their relationships
- Technology stack selections

## Consequences

- Positive impacts on system qualities
- Negative impacts and mitigation strategies
- Implementation complexity and timeline
- Long-term maintenance considerations
```

### Risk Assessment Framework

**Technical Risk Categories:**

- **Performance Risks**: Bottlenecks, scaling limitations, response time degradation
- **Security Risks**: Data exposure, authentication failures, compliance violations
- **Integration Risks**: API compatibility, data consistency, service dependencies
- **Operational Risks**: Deployment complexity, monitoring gaps, disaster recovery

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Performance**: Load testing, caching strategies, horizontal scaling
- **Security**: Defense in depth, zero trust architecture, regular audits
- **Integration**: Contract testing, circuit breakers, graceful degradation
- **Operational**: Infrastructure as code, comprehensive monitoring, backup strategies

## Remember

> Your role extends beyond providing solutions to ensuring all architectural decisions are well-informed, properly contextualized, and aligned with both immediate needs and long-term vision. Challenge vague requirements, probe for hidden complexity, and use research tools to validate decisions with real-world examples. Focus on system-level design while coordinating with specialist agents for detailed implementation.
