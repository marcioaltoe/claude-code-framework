# Release Notes - Claude Code Framework v2.0.0

**Release Date:** August 15, 2025

## üöÄ Major Features

### New `/fix` Command System

- **Unified Fixer Dispatcher**: New `/fix` command that orchestrates specialized fixing agents
- **Multi-scope Support**: Fix all files, staged files, specific paths, or files since a git reference
- **Configurable Fix Levels**: Safe, standard, and aggressive fix modes
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple fixers simultaneously for better performance

### Automated Code Quality Agents

#### üîß Type Fixer Agent

- **Iterative TypeScript Error Resolution**: Automatically fixes TS diagnostics with tight feedback loops
- **Error Code Mapping**: Specialized strategies for common TS errors (TS2307, TS2339, TS7006, etc.)
- **MCP Integration**: Uses Context7 for official TypeScript docs and Perplexity for edge cases
- **Safe to Aggressive Modes**: Configurable fix intensity from safe annotations to aggressive refactoring

#### üéØ Lint Fixer Agent

- **Biome Rule-Aware Fixing**: Parses Biome output and applies minimal, rule-specific edits
- **Auto-fix Integration**: Runs `--fix` first, then handles remaining violations
- **Documentation Integration**: Fetches rule documentation via Context7 for accurate fixes
- **Iterative Approach**: Re-runs linting after each fix batch to ensure progress

#### ‚ö° Vitest Fixer Agent

- **Test Failure Classification**: Groups failures by type (assertions, async, mocking, etc.)
- **Focused Test Runs**: Runs only affected tests for faster feedback
- **Snapshot Management**: Intelligent snapshot update decisions with human-readable diffs
- **Doc-Assisted Fixes**: Uses Context7 for Vitest API patterns and Perplexity for edge cases

#### üì¶ Import Fixer Agent

- **Path Resolution**: Fixes TypeScript path aliasing and module resolution issues
- **Import Type Optimization**: Converts to `import type` where appropriate
- **Default vs Named Imports**: Corrects import/export mismatches based on declarations
- **Index Resolution**: Handles `/index.ts` and extension-less imports

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Config Doctor Agent

- **Configuration Validation**: Cross-checks tsconfig, Biome, and Vitest configurations
- **Alias Consistency**: Ensures path aliases work across all tools
- **Environment Alignment**: Validates test environment settings match usage
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Optional validation before running other fixers

#### üì∏ Snapshot Reviewer Agent

- **Human-Readable Diffs**: Presents clear snapshot changes for review
- **Intent-Based Approval**: Approves updates only when changes reflect intended behavior
- **Integration with Vitest Fixer**: Works seamlessly with test fixing workflows

## üìö Comprehensive Rule System

### Fundamental Design Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Guidelines for avoiding duplication while maintaining clarity
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Practical approaches to avoiding over-engineering
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Strategies for maintaining simplicity in design
- **TDA (Tell, Don't Ask)**: Encapsulation patterns for better object-oriented design

### SOLID Principles Implementation

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Clear guidelines for class and module responsibilities
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Extension strategies without modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Proper inheritance and interface implementation
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Focused, minimal interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Abstraction-based design patterns

### Object Calisthenics Rules

- **9 Core Rules**: Comprehensive guidelines for better object-oriented code
- **Practical Examples**: TypeScript implementations of each rule
- **Benefits Explanation**: Clear rationale for each constraint
- **Team Adoption Strategies**: Guidelines for gradual implementation

### TypeScript Patterns & Standards

- **Type Safety Rules**: Never use `any`, proper interfaces, type guards
- **Function Design Patterns**: Options objects, Result pattern, constructor injection
- **Async/Await Best Practices**: Promise handling, timeout/cancellation, resource management
- **Bun-Specific Patterns**: Native API usage, shell commands, file operations
- **Module System Guidelines**: ES6 imports/exports, barrel exports

### Development Standards

- **Essential Rules**: Core development guidelines covering language, architecture, database, testing
- **Naming Conventions**: Comprehensive naming standards for files, classes, functions, variables
- **Folder Structure**: Feature-driven organization with Clean Architecture principles
- **Code Quality Guidelines**: Small functions, clear control flow, composition over inheritance

## üîÑ Enhanced Agent Ecosystem

### Existing Agent Updates

- **Updated Documentation**: All existing agents now have enhanced documentation

- **Performance Improvements**: Optimized for faster execution and better resource usage

### New Agent Capabilities

- **Zen-Orchestrated Agents**: Several agents now use Zen MCP for advanced orchestration
- **Multi-Model Support**: Primary and analysis models for different tasks
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent JSON logging across all agents

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

### Command Structure Enhancement

- **Hierarchical Commands**: Better organization of fix-related commands under `/fix`
- **Flag-Based Routing**: Intelligent routing based on command flags
- **Scope Controls**: Granular control over what files to process
- **Report Generation**: Optional detailed reports for all fixing operations

### Configuration Management

- **Environment-Specific Configs**: Better separation of development, production, and test configurations
- **Validation Rules**: Built-in validation for configuration consistency
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive configuration examples and templates

### Error Handling & Reporting

- **Structured Error Reporting**: Consistent error formatting across all agents
- **Progress Tracking**: Better visibility into long-running operations
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Safe rollback when fixes introduce new issues

## üìñ Documentation Enhancements

### Rule Documentation

- **Comprehensive Examples**: TypeScript code examples for all rules and patterns
- **Anti-Patterns**: Clear examples of what to avoid
- **Migration Guides**: How to evolve from simple to complex patterns
- **Best Practices**: Practical application guidelines

### Agent Documentation

- **Integration Points**: How agents work together
- **Configuration Options**: All available parameters and their effects
- **Usage Examples**: Practical examples for common scenarios

## üîß Breaking Changes

### File Organization

- **Deleted Rules**: Removed redundant or outdated rule files:
  - `architecture-design-principles.md` (consolidated into `fundamental-design-principles.md`)
  - `code-standards.md` (consolidated into `essentials.md`)
  - `review.md` (integrated into agent documentation)
  - `use-bun-instead-node.md` (integrated into `essentials.md`)

### Command Structure

- **New `/fix` Commands**: Introduction of specialized fix commands may require workflow updates
- **Agent Names**: Some agents have been renamed or reorganized for clarity

## üö¶ Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
