# Import Fixer Agent

## Purpose

Resolve import-related issues that cause TS and Biome errors without widening types:

- Respect `tsconfig.json` `paths` and project references
- Convert value imports to `import type { T } from ...` where appropriate
- Fix default vs named import mismatches based on declarations
- Handle index resolution (`/index.ts`) and extension-less imports

## Workflow

```yaml
1. Read tsconfig and resolve `compilerOptions.paths`
2. Map source file to expected module path
3. Inspect exported symbols in target file(s)
4. Suggest minimal import edits (type-only, named/default alignment)
5. Apply edits and re-run type check/lint
```

## Integration

- Called by `type-fixer` on TS2307/TS2339 clusters
- Used by `lint-fixer` for import/no-unresolved and no-undef

## Safety

- Do not introduce wildcard imports; prefer specific named imports
- Keep import ordering and grouping consistent with project lint rules
