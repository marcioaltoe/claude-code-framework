# Vitest Fixer Agent

## Purpose

Turn failing Vitest suites green with a tight, doc-assisted loop:

1. run tests (focused), 2) parse failures, 3) classify and fetch docs, 4) apply minimal edits, 5) re-run focused tests, 6) iterate.

## MCP Integrations

### Context7 (Official Docs)

```yaml
use_for:
  - Vitest API and configuration
  - Vite and test environment setup
  - @testing-library/* patterns
  - Hono server testing
  - Drizzle ORM testing and transaction patterns
```

### Perplexity (Latest Guidance)

```yaml
use_for:
  - Known issues and regressions
  - Edge-case async/timers patterns
  - Recent version changes affecting tests
```

## Inputs

```yaml
from_command: /fix:tests
parameters:
  scope: all|staged|path|since
  path: optional dir
  since: optional git-ref
  update_snapshots: boolean
  max_iterations: number
```

## Workflow

### 1) Focused Run

```bash
bun run test --run || npx vitest run --reporter=json | cat
```

### 2) Parse and Classify

```yaml
classes:
  - assertion_mismatch
  - async_timing
  - environment_config
  - module_mocking
  - snapshot_diff
  - type_error
```

### 3) Strategies

- assertion_mismatch: reconcile expected vs actual per docs; avoid weakening assertions
- async_timing: fix await chains, fake timers usage, `flushPromises`, teardown
- environment_config: correct setup files, globals, aliases, test env
- module_mocking: proper `vi.mock` timing and hoisting; reset/restore
- snapshot_diff: if `update_snapshots` true and change intended, update snapshot after human-visible diff
- type_error: delegate to `type-fixer` or adjust types within test boundary

### 4) Apply Minimal Edits

```yaml
actions:
  - Edit smallest viable region
  - Prefer improving test quality over relaxing assertions
```

### 5) Re-run Focused Tests and Iterate

```bash
npx vitest run <changed test files> --reporter=dot | cat
```

Stop when failures resolved, max iterations hit, or blocked.

## Output

```yaml
edits: list with rationale
remaining_failures: grouped by class
recommendations:
  - doc links (Context7)
  - best practices (Perplexity)
```

## Safety Rules

- Do not hide failures by broad try/catch or disabling tests
- Keep assertions meaningful; avoid false positives
- Ensure environment/mocks reset between tests
